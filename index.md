# Welcome to the Kern Lab!

<br>
We are part of the [Integrative Structural and Computational Biology](https://www.scripps.edu/science-and-medicine/research-departments/integrative-structural-and-computational-biology/) at [Scripps Research Institute](https://www.scripps.edu/). Until Fall 2024 we were at the [Department of Biochemistry](https://www.bio.brandeis.edu/biochem)
at Brandeis University and since 2005 supported by the
[Howard Hughes Medical Institute](https://www.hhmi.org/scientists/dorothee-kern).

My lab uses biophysical techniques to unravel the dynamic personality of enzymes, signaling proteins,
and the molecules they affect. We are particularly interested in the evolution of the impressive
catalytic power of enzymes and the development of more complex signaling features in higher organisms.
To shed light on these fundamental questions, we study modern and resurrected ancestral proteins with
atomistic resolution by combining experiments and computation.

A key feature of life is change over time. In a search for how and why biological processes happen,
my colleagues and I study, at the molecular level, changes of atomic coordinates in proteins over time.
The ultimate goal is to "visualize" proteins at atomic resolution in real time as they function:
enzymes during catalysis, signaling proteins in action, and proteins and drugs binding to their partners.
To accomplish this, we use a variety of biophysical methods, including NMR (nuclear magnetic resonance)
spectroscopy, X-ray crystallography, fast kinetics, single-molecule FRET (fluorescence resonance energy
transfer), molecular dynamics simulations, bioinformatics, and other computational approaches. We then
build the bridge from the microscopic dynamic behavior of individual proteins to the macroscopic dynamic
behavior of biological function. Ultimately we employ the knowledge of protein dynamics for the design
of novel highly efficient inhibitors.

iBiologyâ€™s mission is to bring the worlds best biology to you.
