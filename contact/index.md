#### Directions

Brandeis University is easy to reach by public transport or car; the official directions for getting to campus are [here](https://www.brandeis.edu/about/visiting/directions.html).

The [MBTA commuter train](https://www.mbta.com/schedules_and_maps/rail/lines/?route=FITCHBRG&direction=O&timing=W&RedisplayTime=Redisplay+Time) to Brandeis from Boston and Cambridge is infrequent, but fast (~15 minutes). The train route is the Fitchburg line, which starts at North Station in Boston and stops at Porter Square in Cambridge on its way to Brandeis. From the Brandeis/Roberts stop, it is a short walk (~10 mintues) to the "The Volen National Center for Complex Systems" as marked with a yellow line on the map below. If you are driving to campus, please contact us so that we can arrange for a parking permit and we will provide instructions on where to park. Alternatively, you can stop yourself at the main entrance (if open) or the Public Safety office (shown in cyan) to pick up a permit and they will assign you a parking lot.
