We are saying good bye to Aedan Using and Gilbert Otoo following our move to Scripps. The two athlete-scientists will continue their journey in both basketball and research: Aedan is continuing his graduate studies at Brandeis University, while Gilbert will further his career at Johns Hopkins University. The Kern lab is excited to see what they will accomplish next!
